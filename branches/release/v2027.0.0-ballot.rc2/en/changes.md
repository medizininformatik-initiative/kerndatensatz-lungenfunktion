## Changelog

This page records the changes between the released versions of the **Lungenfunktion (Pulmonary Function)** module, newest version first. It follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the KDS calendar versioning scheme described on the [Versioning](version-history.md) page.

Each version gets its own section with the release date and the changes grouped by category:

* **Added** — new profiles, extensions, value sets, search parameters, pages.
* **Changed** — modified constraints, bindings, guidance or documentation.
* **Deprecated** — artifacts that still exist but should no longer be used.
* **Removed** — artifacts that were withdrawn.
* **Fixed** — corrections of defects.
* **Security** — changes with a security or data-protection impact.

Leave out the categories with nothing to report. Where a change is driven by an issue or a pull request, link it.

##### Breaking changes MUST be reported and explained

A version section that contains a breaking change is not complete until it answers, explicitly and in this changelog:

* **What exactly changed** between the two versions — the artifact, the element, the old and the new constraint (not just "profile X was revised").
* **What it means for existing data:** does data that conformed to the previous version still validate against the new one? If not, which resources and elements are affected, and how does the failure show up?
* **What implementers should do:** the authors' recommendation for migrating existing data to the new version — transformation steps, default values, re-coding guidance — or an explicit statement that no migration path is provided and why.

**What counts as breaking** — treat a change as breaking if it does any of the following, even when it looks small: tightens a cardinality (`0..*` → `1..1`), raises a binding strength (example → required), removes codes from a required value set, removes or renames an element or a slice, narrows a type, adds an invariant or a must-support obligation, or changes a canonical URL. When in doubt, report it as breaking.

**Breaking for whom:** state both perspectives — *stored data* (instances valid against the old version) and *implementations* (clients and servers built against it; a removed search parameter breaks implementations while every stored instance stays valid).

**The version number will not warn anyone.** The KDS calendar versioning scheme (`YYYY.n.n`) carries no major-version signal the way SemVer does — this changelog section is the *only* warning a reader gets.

**Link the technical delta.** From the second formal publication on, enable the IG Publisher's version comparison (`version-comparison` in `sushi-config.yaml` — see the [ Versioning](version-history.md) page for the setup and its prerequisites); it publishes a machine-generated comparison at `comparison-v<previous>/index.html`. Link it from the version section, so the prose explanation and the technical diff sit side by side.

Mark such entries clearly (for example, prefix them with **BREAKING:**) so a reader scanning the section cannot miss them.
